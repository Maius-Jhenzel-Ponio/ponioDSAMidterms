## 🧐 What is React.js?

**React.js** is a popular JavaScript library for building fast, dynamic user interfaces, particularly for single-page applications (SPAs). Developed and maintained by **Meta (formerly Facebook)** and an active community of developers, React introduces a **declarative** and **component-based** approach to building UIs. 

### Key Features

- **🔗 Component-Based Architecture**: Break your UI into reusable, self-contained components.
- **⚡ Virtual DOM**: React’s virtual DOM efficiently updates only the parts of the page that change.
- **💻 JSX Syntax**: Write HTML directly within JavaScript, making code more readable and modular.

React has transformed the way we build UIs, allowing developers to focus on describing what the UI should look like while React efficiently handles the DOM updates.
